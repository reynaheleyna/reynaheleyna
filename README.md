## 🧬 About Me

Hi, I'm **H Barrameda**, a Filipina tech practitioner navigating the ultra-hip merge of digital transformation, knowledge management, and content both creative and technical. I code with clarity, I write with passion, and I lead with luminous sovereignty.

- 🔭 Currently building: `Curiosettee` – where intellectual backend meets energetic frequency (and a bunch of other work stuff)
- 🌱 Studying: FinOps, some DevOps, Technical Writing and Knowledge Management, a bunch of Systems and Analytics
- 👯 I see myself working well with ... lifelong learners, FinOps folks, and technology professionals who hate documenting their work but need good technical documentation
